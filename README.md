python practice

## Formally a place for me to practice the following:

1 - command line GIT
2 - Python
3 - Natural EMACS
4 - All those cool Python data science tools

## Informally, something to make it harder to finish editing my thesis

1 - Really not a great idea
2 - Bad ideas are just good ideas that need more time (or alcohol)
